ntro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/index.html) website design.

1. The Design is very Simple, which for me is a plus, others may think that minimalist is not a positive but I am not of that opinion.

2. The way the layout is formed in a grid is very logical

3. The "Cards" seem like they are raised the way the shadowing works which is very appealing visually.

4. Sometimes, I feel that there is too much repitive content on a page, even though the hard content is not the same, 

5. the design looks repitive at times and maybe could vary more from screen to screen.
